## Project overview
The Onyx Marketing Campaign Analysis project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of various ad campaigns conducted on different channels such as Facebook. The data includes metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and more, segmented by date, city, and device.
## Explanation
### S - Situation:
Onyx wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns across various digital channels (e.g., Facebook) by analyzing impressions, clicks, conversions, and engagement metrics. The goal was to determine which channels, cities, and devices performed best and optimize ad spend accordingly.

#### T - Task:
I was responsible for analyzing the dataset to identify key trends, compare channel performance, assess device-based engagement, and provide cost-efficiency insights. Additionally, I needed to visualize key findings to support data-driven decision-making.

#### A - Action:
- Cleaned and processed the dataset to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations like correlation matrices, scatter plots, and bar charts to identify patterns.
- Analyzed impressions, clicks, and conversion rates across different cities, channels, and devices.
- Evaluated cost-effectiveness using metrics like Daily Average CPC and spend vs. conversion value.
- Built a live dashboard for real-time monitoring of campaign performance.
#### R - Result:
- Discovered that Spring campaigns had the widest engagement, while Summer had lower impressions and clicks.
- Found that November had the highest sales conversions, showing a seasonal trend.
- Identified a moderate correlation (0.3) between Likes and Shares, but minimal correlation between Shares and Comments.
- Helped optimize ad spending by identifying high-performing cities and cost-effective channels.
